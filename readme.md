The core star that powers Aurora Gaming Networks. Nova is a Bukkit plugin designed specifically for Aurora Gaming Networks, which aims to handle every aspect of the servers it runs on: from chat formatting and permissions management, to player velocity launch pads and advanced logging, and everything in-between.
